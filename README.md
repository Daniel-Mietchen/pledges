# About

This repo contains materials about things I am publicly committed to. 

# Pledge

I pledge to observe the following principles in my knowledge-related professional and volunteering activities:

1. only engage in activities where I see sufficient societal benefit;
1. publicly document my insights into the societal benefits of activities that take up a major part of my time;
1. take measures to minimize the likelihood that engagement in these activities is detrimental to the health or well-being of myself or others;
1. share my gratitude and appreciation for providers of and contributors to resources that I find relevant;
1. encourage open participation, scrutiny and repurposing of the processes and workflows underlying my activities;
1. release public outputs of my activities under an [open license](https://opendefinition.org/licenses/), and under the [CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication (CC0 1.0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) if I am the sole contributor;
1. present these principles as my starting point when negotiating collaborations with others;
1. maintain a [list of frequently asked questions](faq.md) (FAQ) related to activities covered by these principles;
1. allow for exceptions, and feed data about them into future versions of these principles;
1. review these principles and the associated FAQ at least annually and refine them as necessary.
