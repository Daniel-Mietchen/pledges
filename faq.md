# About

This file contains clarifications pertaining to questions I am frequently posed about my [pledges](README.md), though not necessarily in the same way. If you have additional questions or need further clarifications, please let me know.

  - Yes 

## Editing

* Am I available as an editor for scholarly venues?
  - Yes, if
    - I have sufficient expertise.
    - All publications in the venue are openly licensed.
    - The publishing fees are reasonable or absent.
    - The journal and/ or its publisher have signed the [San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment](https://sfdora.org/).

      - integration with CiTO
      - mapping of content to societal challenges
      - perks for editors 

## Events

* Am I willing to 
  - attend remotely?
    - Yes
  - fly 
    - [I have abandoned flights to destinations where I would spend less than a month](https://noflyclimatesci.org/biographies/daniel-mietchen)
  - organize remotely?
    - Yes
  - present remotely?
    - Yes
  - experiment with formats?
    - Yes
 
## Interviews

* Am I willing to be interviewed?
  - Yes, if
    - I have sufficient expertise in the topic.
    - The interview results in at least some materials that are openly licensed.

## Languages

* How do I engage with other cultures?
  - I do that in multiple ways, but the most profound of them is probably that I will not spend more than 7 days in a row in a country where I can't speak any of the official languages decently enough for everyday conversations (i.e. A2 or higher in [CEFR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages)). While this may seem like a strong limit, I prefer to see it as a matter of respect and a challenge, i.e. rather than giving up on such countries, I will learn one of its languages to at least A2 level before arriving in the country. Once in that new linguistic environment, I will pay attention to cultural sensitivities around using one language or another in specific contexts. In particular, I will avoid using colonial languages whenever possible.
* What languages do I speak?
  - I am a native speaker of German and can speak English, French and Russian at a professional level. I am familiar with dozens of other languages to varying degrees and always happy to explore how I could use them in a meaningful way. For a rough overview, see [here](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Daniel_Mietchen/Babel). I deeply enjoy playing with languages, and I help document them on Wikidata, where they can be explored, for instance, by the [Ordia](https://ordia.toolforge.org/) tool to which I contribute.

## Letters of reference

* Am I willing to provide letters of reference?
  - Yes, if 
    - I know enough about whoever is to be portrayed in the letter.
    - I understand the context for which the reference is sought.
    - I know the requested language well enough to provide such a letter.
    - I can base a good part of the letter on publicly verifiable information.
    - The timeline works out.

## Licensing

* What is the licensing of things that I shared in public?
  - In many cases, this is stated explicitly. If not, then my contributions to it are to be considered to be under the [CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication (CC0 1.0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). So if I am the sole contributor to something, it is to be considered to be available under the terms of CC0 1.0. Nonetheless, I would appreciate attribution and even notification where practical. Note that I did sign some copyright transfer agreements in the past, but the last time I did that was around 2012.

## Peer review

### General provisions

* Am I available as a peer reviewer for scholarly resources?
  - Yes, if all of the following conditions are met
    - I have sufficient expertise.
    - I find the resource intriguing or at least interesting in some way.
    - I can find the time.

### Specific provisions

*These apply in addition to the general ones.*

* Am I available as a peer reviewer for scholarly manuscripts?
  - Yes, if all of the following conditions are met
    - All publications in the venue are openly licensed.
    - The materials I am to review are public and openly licensed at the moment my review is requested.
* Am I available as a peer reviewer for scholarly grant proposals?
  - Yes, with a strong preference for proposals that are made public
  - Details depend on who asks
    - Grant authors
      - Yes, if they can demonstrate an intent to publish the proposal (e.g. by pointing to another one that is already public)
    - Funders
      - Yes, if they have useful responses to my questions:
        -  What are you doing to address the prevailing [perverse incentives](https://scholia.toolforge.org/topic/Q100434356) in academia?
        -  What is the timeline for the reviews?
        -  How do you plan to match the proposals to the reviewers?
        -  What precise information do you require from reviewers? Is there a form to fill in or a rubric to follow, and if so, can I see them beforehand?
        -  How long are the proposals I am expected to review?
        -  What aspect of the proposals are going to be public?
        -  Will data management plans or other associated materials be part of the review process? If so, how?
        -  Will there be any form of interaction between reviewers for a given proposal, or between reviewers and authors (e.g. an author response to reviewer comments)?
    - Others, e.g. grant reviewers or journalists
      - Depends, but generally yes if what they produce on that basis is publicly available under an open license.
* Am I available as a peer reviewer for scholarly data?
  - Yes, if the data are open or have at least open metadata
* Am I available as a peer reviewer for scholarly software?
  - Yes, if the source code is public and openly licensed
* Am I available as a peer reviewer for scholarly output management plans?
  - Yes, if they are made public
* Am I available as a peer reviewer for other outputs of scholarly workflows?
  - Yes, especially if they are made public

## Publishing

As an author or co-author of scholarly manuscripts, am I willing
  - to post the manuscripts as preprints?
    - Yes, if
      - they are put under an open license
  - to pay open-access charges?
    - Yes, if 
      - appropriate funding is available
      - fees are reasonable
  - to publish behind paywalls?
    - No  
  - to publish under non-open licenses?
    - No  
  - to sign copyright transfer agreements?
    - No

## Where do I "document my insights into the societal benefits or environmental impacts of activities that take up a major part of my time", as per principle 2?

*This is still in flux but below are some pointers. I might eventually move this to a dedicated file.*

- Alignment between the Sustainable Development Goals and RIO Journal is documented [here](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.7.e68595).
- Alignment between the Sustainable Development Goals and Wikimedia activities was the subject of a [dedicated Wikimania 2021 session](https://wikimania.wikimedia.org/wiki/2021:Submissions/Wikimedia_and_Sustainability-Selecting_topics_for_impact). The mapping is [still incomplete](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/1480), but I am [thinking of making a personalized version](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/1481) somehow.
- I have begun to include dedicated sections on environmental impact into manuscripts I co-authored, e.g. [here](https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giad113) and [here](https://doi.org/10.4230/TGDK.2.2.4).
