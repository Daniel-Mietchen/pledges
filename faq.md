## Where do I "document my insights into the societal benefits of activities that take up a major part of my time", as per principle 2?

*This is still in flux but below are some pointers. I might eventually move this to a dedicated file.*

- Alignment between the Sustainable Development Goals and RIO Journal is documented [here](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.7.e68595).
- Alignment between the Sustainable Development Goals and Wikimedia activities was the subject of a [dedicated Wikimania 2021 session](https://wikimania.wikimedia.org/wiki/2021:Submissions/Wikimedia_and_Sustainability-Selecting_topics_for_impact). The mapping is [still incomplete](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/1480), but I am [thinking of making a personalized version](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/1481) somehow.
